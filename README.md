Greetings, Readers,

I am pleased to share that I have successfully completed this project independently. I developed the Rest API using the Spring Boot framework, focusing on the persistence of user data and incorporating user authorization functionalities. I trust that you will find this reading enjoyable and informative.


# <span style="color:blue"> Tech Stack Used: </span>
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- MySQL
- Hibernate
- Core Java
- Postman

# Features of Application:
1. Users, police, and police stations can register themselves.
2. Users can log into the system.
3. The application allows a user to file an FIR against multiple users
4. Each police Station has a list of FIRs filed there, and one Officer In Charge  
5. Each police has a list of FIRs filed by him &  list of FIRs (cases) closed by him
6. Each FIR must have the details of 
    - User who filed the FIR
    - List of Users against whom FIR is filed
    - Police who filed the FIR
    - Police Station where FIR was filed
    - Whether the case is open or closed

Let me share my experience,<br>
The process of developing this project has been incredibly rewarding. It has provided me with extensive learning opportunities and significantly boosted my confidence. While I envisioned incorporating additional functionalities, time constraints restricted my ability to do so. Nevertheless, I am committed to refining and expanding the project in the future, gradually implementing the envisioned features.

# <span style="color:red">Challenges: </span>
During the project development, I encountered several challenges that, although time-consuming, provided valuable learning experiences. Some of the key challenges included:

1. **Establishing Entity-Level Relationships**: As the sole contributor, I invested significant time in meticulously crafting entity-level relationships. This required thoughtful consideration and development to ensure seamless connections between various elements.

2. **API Interaction and Debugging with Postman**: When faced with API-related errors, I adopted a precise and systematic approach while utilizing Postman. This strategic method facilitated effective debugging and ensured the establishment of a well-structured setup.

3. **Implementing Drag-and-Drop for Pickup and Drop Locations**: Integrating the drag-and-drop feature for pickup and drop locations demanded special attention. I focused on creating a user-friendly experience while maintaining functionality and accuracy.

4. **Integration Challenges**: During the integration phase, I encountered some difficulties which I diligently worked through. These challenges, though demanding, enabled me to enhance my problem-solving skills and refine the integration process.

5. **Real-Time Data Processing**: Working with real-time data posed its own set of challenges. Nevertheless, I embraced this opportunity to develop proficiency in handling dynamic data streams and leveraging them effectively within the project.

In spite of these hurdles, I am proud of how the project has evolved. Each challenge provided insights and lessons that will undoubtedly contribute to my growth as a developer.


# <span style="color:red">Conclusion: </span>
I am grateful to myself and optimistic about the future. I eagerly anticipate implementing the features and functionalities that I have envisioned as an expansion of this project.
